This project uses machine learning to predict the impact of nutrient combinations on taxonomic groups classified as "NORMAL" and "DEVIANT". The pipeline processes taxonomic and nutrient data, categorizing taxons into underrepresented, overrepresented, or normal classes. It then applies a randomized algorithm to identify the best nutrient combinations, which are used to train a deep learning model for predicting nutrient impact scores. The model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and provides a classification of nutrient impact as "Good", "Bad", or "Neutral". The project includes an interactive feature for users to select nutrient combinations and evaluate their predicted impact on health or disease.
